**Ex.2 | Semantic HTML**

- Use semantic tags for your website,
- Create a simple website with a nav, header, footer, and a main section.
- Nav should have a link
- Header should have a title heading.
- Footer can have a copyright message.
- Within your html do not focus on the look but rather make sure the content is displayed correctly.
- We'll use css to style this content next.
